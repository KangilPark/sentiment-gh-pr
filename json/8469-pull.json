[search][search-atom-org-label-enhancement] | A feature request. |\n+| `bug` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-bug] | [search][search-atom-org-label-bug] | A confirmed bug or issue very likely to be a bug. |\n+| `question` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-question] | [search][search-atom-org-label-question] | A question more than a bug report or feature request (e.g. how do I do X). |\n+| `feedback` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-feedback] | [search][search-atom-org-label-feedback] | General feedback more than a bug report or feature request. |\n+| `help-wanted` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-help-wanted] | [search][search-atom-org-label-help-wanted] | The Atom core team would appreciate help from the community in resolving these issues. |\n+| `beginner` |

Issue is blocked on another issue. |\n+| `duplicate` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-duplicate] | [search][search-atom-org-label-duplicate] | Issue is a duplicate of another issue. |\n+| `wontfix` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-wontfix] | [search][search-atom-org-label-wontfix] | The Atom core team decided not to fix this issue for now, either because it's working as intended or for some other reason. |\n+| `invalid` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-invalid] | [search][search-atom-org-label-invalid] | Issue isn't valid (e.g. user error). |\n+| `package-idea` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-package-idea] | [search][search-atom-org-label-package-idea] | A feature request which might be a good candidate for a new package, instead of extending Atom or a core Atom package. |\n+| `wrong-repo` | [search][search-atom-repo-label-wrong-repo] | [search][search-atom-org-label-wrong-repo] | Issue was reported on the wrong repository (e.g. a bug related to a

I removed the latter, but decided to keep this one for now, since it's been used once :one:. One of my motivations for documenting _everything_ (or as much of everything as possible :smile:) was a hope that users who read this might have ideas and suggest better labels/workflows for the project.\n",
