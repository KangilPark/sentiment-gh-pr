you don't need this if it's the negation of the loop condition

:-1: overkill to get all the workspaces when you're only looking for one
getProperty breaks encapsulation of the serialization code (maybe one day we'll base64encode our property names???) but i'm not sure i can recommend `loadObject[Workspace](vertex).workspaceId` as an alternative and keep my dignity
I don't think there is an actual difference, all the gremlin pipelines execute locally (not on the orient server) so we are pulling back all those vertices anyway only to discard them.
you're still doing all the work to build permissions lists for a bunch of workspaces you don't care about
you could probably make us both happy by making the loop emit function a parameter or something.
