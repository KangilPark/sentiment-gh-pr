The "In the future…" sentence can now be removed from the above comment.
I think these commented lines (160 and 162) can be deleted. (We wouldn't want a workshop attendee to uncomment them.)
Renaming `main()` to `executeExample()` requires corresponding modifications to [README.md](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/blob/master/OpenSim/Sandbox/ExampleHopperDevice/README.md) (bottom), exampleHopperDevice.cpp ([line 35](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/blob/master/OpenSim/Sandbox/ExampleHopperDevice/exampleHopperDevice.cpp#L35)), and exampleHopperDevice_answers.cpp ([line 35](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/blob/master/OpenSim/Sandbox/ExampleHopperDevice/exampleHopperDevice_answers.cpp#L35)).

`(append subcomponent to the end of Component's _orderedSubcomponents list if it isn't already in the list)`?
Nevermind - the comment for this method in Component.h looks good.
subomponents -> subcomponents

Ideally, would `realizeSubsystemDynamicsImpl()` just take a non-const state? The comment seems sufficient if we don't want to start fiddling with CMC's architecture.
Why is the "enforce constraints" flag set for the last coordinate (as opposed to, say, `i==0`)? Perhaps a comment would be helpful here, since this seems to be a minor change to the algorithm.
I was expecting this code to be more similar to the code above (lines 645–650) when a WeldConstraint is added. The comment above about JointSet (lines 611–612) suggests that JointSet will eventually disappear, so should `addJoint(free)` be `adoptSubcomponent(free)` instead? (In `addJoint()`, it looks like `free` will be adopted by the JointSet, which will eventually disappear.)
I also arbitrarily chose `executeExample()` and I am happy to change it while I am revising. Any preferences: `runHopperExample` or `hopToIt()` ?
Was this line commented out to allow nested Models (i.e., Ground isn't necessarily at the top of the Component list)? Perhaps delete altogether or add a "TODO" for when nested Models are fully implemented.
Since we are setting all the coordinate values, I wait to the last coordinate before enforcing the constraints. The default is to enforce constraints on every `setValue()`.  I will add a clarifying comment.
That's a good point. It currently would serialize the FreeJoint (having been added to the JointSet), so I agree adopting directly would not have that affect (like the hidden Welds that are added to break loops). I will update.
I like `hopToIt()` :rabbit2:, but it isn't descriptive so we probably shouldn't encourage in a workshop example. `runHopperExample()` sounds good to me.
> Since we are setting all the coordinate values, I wait to the last coordinate before enforcing the constraints.Ah, ok. I think the algorithm is slightly different now because, previously, all the coordinate values could have changed slightly for every `0 <= i < nq-1`—but the tolerance is probably so small that the results don't change substantially (and the new way seems correct, since the projection should be independent of the order in which the coordinates are set).
It was a previous hack to force Ground to be added first. I will delete!
The issue is that the CMCActuatorSubsystemRep has it own secret internal State (_completeState) which it updates. Computation is not supposed change the System (or subsystem). It is a bad implementation and I would rather not change it. All I did was gather it to one `const_cast` instead of having three.
> All I did was gather it to one `const_cast` instead of having three.Ok, sounds good. Thanks for explaining.
I'm afraid the order of the states could change again in the future.
Seems okay to me but I'm curious. What caused this to be necessary? Are you sure that silently passing is the correct thing to do, instead of throwing an exception?
Why don't member or adopted subcomponents need to be ordered with the property subcomponents?
Sorry; forget this comment. I need to get a better understanding of the changes first.
Despite Tom's excitement, I don't think this is what we should do. `_desiredStatesStorage` is a non-owning pointer and it's effectively being used as an owning pointer now. If the memory management has changed, then `_desiredStatesStorage` should be changed to a `SimTK::ResetOnCopy<std::unique_ptr<Storage>`, or something like that.Did you discover a leak? If so, where?I think it would be good to also edit the doxygen for this method to mention the memory management.
> Despite Tom's excitement, I don't think this is what we should do.I didn't perform a thorough analysis of this change. I checked [the commit where this change was made](https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core/pull/1205/commits/02b4c1cc8509d758a245e65acd6d63c0251dfa79), and it seemed as though @aseth1 just happened to find the leak and patched it up without redoing the whole kitchen. If further analysis is necessary, I suggest opening a new issue to investigate since this class seems unrelated to the point of this PR.
Yeah...I would prefer that this change is undone and a new Issue be created.
I agree. But that wasn't the reason for the change. Tightening the tolerances was the main purpose. As far as I can tell the order has been wrong since we started using the `MultibodyGraphMaker` but the tolerances were to loose make a difference.
Now that Component writers can dictate the order of subcomponents this will often mean cycling through Component lists of specific types, and it will be difficult to to guarantee they are attempting to add components only once. Since property changes should wipe out the system, this should be safe to do. My inclination is that it is too harsh to throw an Exception in this case.`Component::setNextSubcomponentInSystem()` only appends the component to the list of ordered subcomponents if the subcomponent is not already in the list, so it is unique for a given Component. However, each subcomponent also has its own list.But there is nothing stopping the component from directly calling `addToSystem` on a subcomponent. Note that previously, we didn't check and simply added the component to the system again. So this at least fixes that problem.Here is the use case. A Model has Ground, Bodies, PhysicalOffsetFrames (POFs), Joints, Forces and user defined Components (like a Device). Some Joints have their own POFs (as subcomponents) and others connect to POFs somewhere else in the Model (like on Bodies or a Device). The MultibodyGraphMaker dictates which Bodies and POFs are to be added first to define each Joint in multibody tree order until the POFs, Bodies and Joints that make up the multibody tree are part of the System. At this point there are still POFs (not specifically part of the multibody tree) that have not been added to the System yet (think POF of the Device for attaching it). So a reasonable thing to do is to cycle through all POFs and add them next sinces, POFs act as attachment sites for other components (e.g. Stations, Forces, Device). POFs that were added as a requirement for the building the tree will already be present and I think it makes sense to now ignore them as the Model does another pass to make sure all POFs are added before attempting to add other Components to the System.Let me know if you agree.
`_orderedSubcomponents` is just a way for a Component to dictate the order in which subcomponents get added to the System. If the Component writer has no requirement on order then the list is auto generated in ownership traversal order. It includes all subcomponents regardless of internal designation (member, property, adopted)
