How does one obtain crash reports on Windows and Linux? I have no idea, but would love to add links :link: or instructions :memo: here.
Is there an easy-to-use tool (similar to licecap) for recording GIFs on Linux? 
I think I used [byzanz](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Ubuntu, but it's nowhere near as easy to use as LICEcap. Most Linux solutions for this are rather janky Bash scripts that require you to manually figure out the exact pixel position of the window you want to capture.
