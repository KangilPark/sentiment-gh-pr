Where should one open an Issue? Should they all just be opened on atom/atom?Should we have a `label` label? :laughing:
Super minor, but there's an extra space between `GitHub` and `search` :art:
`pull request` -> `pull requests`?
:art: `that every issue has a label` -> `that every issue have a label`?
:art: I think there's an extra space between `discussed` and `for`
`at next meeting` -> `at the next meeting`?
`or Atom core team member` maybe?
How about `Most labels are used across all atom repositories, but some are specific to atom/atom`?
`[...]or something that is very likely to be a bug`
:art: issue -> issuesSo `Less complex issues which would be good places to start for users[...]`?
This label has never been used yet, so perhaps :fire:?
has decided
It might be better to be more specific here, eg `a bug related to the settings view was reported on atom/atom`.
`Issues created for any uncaught exceptions, ...`?

This could also be a candidate for removal - it's only been used once.
:art: `The Atom core team's roadmap post version 1.0.0`
atom/atom is missing `:mag_right:`
Both are missing `:mag_right:`
> This could also be a candidate for removal - it's only been used once.Thanks for pointing this out, @50Wliu, and that `triage-help-needed` label. I removed the latter, but decided to keep this one for now, since it's been used once :one:. One of my motivations for documenting _everything_ (or as much of everything as possible :smile:) was a hope that users who read this might have ideas and suggest better labels/workflows for the project.
