Should this comparison include a trailing slash on `USERPROFILE`?Currently this check will pass for the following `process.execPath`/`USERPROFILE` right?`process.execPath = C:\Users\KevinSawicki\atom\atom.exe``USERPROFILE = C:\Users\Kevin`
`loadSettings` might be null, see `isRunningCoreSpecs` for an example of guards typically around it.
This is a typo that I fixed but didn't push apparently, this should be `LOCALAPPDATA`, which makes _way_ more sense :)
Yeah, totally :+1: 
:+1:, will fix
I don't think you need the `process and` check here, since the line before already calls `process.platform` without checking `process`.
Could you add a comment above this line that just adds some example paths and says which ones are considered portable and which ones are not?
This is copy-pasta from the apm version, will fix
What is the use of checking `process.type` here?I am newbie :P
@PikachuEXE No use in this case, copy pasta from apm
Is this line needed? The return value doesn't appear to be used
I think `fs.realpathSync` throws an error when it doesn't exist so I think we might still want to have a `try` statement around it and just ignore the error when it doesn't exist.
I think we usually write this as `path.join(execDirectoryPath, '..', '.atom')` so that the `/` isn't hard-coded
`path.join` always returns a string so I don't think you need the `toString` here.
I should have left a comment above this line originally about this but I think this is still needed on Linux based on this comment: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5412#issuecomment-73119795Maybe we can pass `atomHome` as a load setting and set it as an env var still which would remove the code duplication.
:heart: 
It looks like args is no longer used here so would you mind backing out this change here?
done
Could you rename this to `isPortableAtomHomePathWritable` to match the style of `isPortableInstall`?
`arg` appears to be unused here so it looks like it is save to just remove it.
Does this need to be moved here in this pull request? Or could it go back to under the `app.setAppUserModelId('com.squirrel.atom.atom')` line?
:fire: looks like some trailing whitespace here
