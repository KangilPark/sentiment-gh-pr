Use a different variable name besides `member` here in case it is confused with the previous line.Also, you can use the pattern-matched variable directly instead of `memberToAdd.left.get`
make comment plural
I'd prefer `listAdmins()` to make it explicit that this is a method call
I didn't write this, just moved it out of WorkspaceService. If we decide to keep them here and not remove them altogether then I'm sure that can be taken care of.
On a related note, I should probably either close the other PR that does exactly this, or not do it in this PR since it seems that we need to discuss it as a group a bit more.
Why is adding an already-admin successful, but deleting a non-admin an error?
I'm not seeing any changes to WorkspaceService as part of this PR.  Do you need to commit those?
The group is loaded and saved once per new member.  It would be better to collect the new members so they can be added all at once.
This is not testing the correct endpoint.  Change to `/admin/groups` with appropriate JSON entity.
Add a member to the subgroup to show that list members doesn't show it because it only goes down one level.
How is this different from the "when listing the members of a group" test?
put into main group
Yeah this test is redundant and can be removed.
:-1: return statements, this should map each list of emails to load the object, concatenate those 2 lists then return  !list.exists(None)
use ErrorReport
comment what this function does in the case of failures
is there any commonality between add and remove that can be factored out... the code looks virtually identical
