WIP: First stab at custom element for panesStill need to create a SpacePen shim for access via `atom.workspaceView`property so we’re backward compatible with packages, but it basicallyworks.
Handle pane commands on PaneElement via command registry
Keep existing PaneView SpacePen API working as beforeWe will eventually deprecate all access to views via`atom.workspaceView`, which is the only way to get a reference toinstances of PaneView. Draining the swamp!
Use Pane::onDidAddItem instead of ::observeItemsThe former includes the index at which the item was added and the latterdoes not.
Remove Pane::getViewClass as we now use a view provider
Restore $.fn.element propertyWe define element in certain space-pen views, but this makes itavailable for all jQuery objects. Can’t remove it from the prototype.
:lipstick:
Upgrade autosave to fix specs
Add PaneAxisElement
Upgrade space-pen for simulated dom attachment bug fix
Only dispose PaneElement subscriptions when pane is destroyedNot when the element is detached, because it might be reattached.
Don’t emit repeated attached events for the same PaneView
Remove the old root view properly
Remove stray log
Move shell command installation to workspace model
Move PaneContainerView::confirmClose to the model layer
Mock out document.title with Object.definePropertyPreviously the WorkspaceView::setTitle was mocked in specs to preventthe title from changing. But I would like to move the title update logicwithout breaking assertions, so now we can assert directly ondocument.title.
Maintain document.title in the workspace model, not the view
Update document edited status in workspace modelThis also fixes a previous oversight where the status wasn’t updatedwhen switching between pane items with different modified status.
Add WorkspaceElement
Apply workaround for clearing of focus upon loading of windowAfter the first window focus event, the focus is getting cleared backto document.body regardless of the prior active element. Refocusingworkspace on a delay after the first window focus event works aroundthe problem.
Clean up debugging
More cleanup
Remove methods carried over from old view
Rename deprecatedViewEvents to deprecateViewEvents
:lipstick: spec language
Move shell command installation entirely into CommandInstaller
Make $::view return __spacePenView from the first element if present
Allow WorkspaceView to be instantiated directly for compatibility
Fix command-installer-spec
