First version of throughput-limited routing.
Router will pick up packet on first tick it appears if bandwidth is infinite.
Router scheduling multiple packets, batch-processing packets when they fit within bandwidth.
Adjust packet scheduling to happen on message queue change instead of on tick, and add test to demonstrate pessimistic scheduling.
Add log2 scale slider control to UI, not hooked up to anything yet.
Attach bandwidth control to shared router property.
Remove unused method in NetSimRouterNode
Add options to level configuration for hiding the bandwidth control and for setting its default value.
Levelbuilder support for router bandwidth options.
Use lodash find instead of unsupported Array.prototype.find.  Oops
Test simplification
Clean up code that selects messages past their scheduled time and ready to route.
Throw on bad method call
Style changes, reduce nesting
Further style adjustments, this time on utility methods.
